                <h2>Our Research Study</h2>
                <p>Drowsiness and fatigue in students are some of the leading causes of failing. This research study focuses on detecting drowsiness via a webcam in computer users specifically, studying the environmental contributors which are obtained through a questionnaire and then building a recommendation system to counteract drowsiness and enhance maximum productivity. Additional features include taking a screenshot of the screen when the user has become inactive for a certain period of time and then putting the computer to sleep after saving the screenshot. Similar studies have only been conducted on drivers of vehicles. This system deals with artificial intelligence and drowsiness detection based on visual information obtained through a model built in python to calculate the user’s Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and compare it to a threshold value before sounding an alarm if drowsiness is detected. This idea is further scientifically supported by associating it with slow eye closure. The model can be improved by adding yawning as a factor for drowsiness detection. </p>

                <h2>Conclusion and Recommendations</h2>
                <p>All tests had to be conducted in an environment with good lighting which ultimately eliminated testing at night time or in dark rooms.
                    We have drawn direct correlations between the font size and the number of times the alarm was sounded during our tests and can confidently state that the smaller the font size, the more the user will struggle to read what is written on the computer screen. The same applies to the screen brightness. 
                    <br><br>
                    After analysing the results of how the participants fared when looking at the number charts, it can be said that there are weaknesses in our model because the alarm was only triggered when the participants looked at numbers in the bottom rows of both sheets of the document. This is due to the fact that the model assumes that the user’s eyes are drowsy instead of recognising that the user has slightly closed their eyes to look lower down on the screen.

                    <br><br>
                    Participants who preferred a chair with good back support and sat at a desk performed better than those who preferred working while sitting on their bed. This is because there is less back strain on the user while sitting on a chair therefore the user is able to focus for a longer period of time and is less likely to become drowsy. 
                    <br><br>

                    The biggest improvement to the model would be to combine it with a Mouth Aspect Ratio detector for yawning. This would be the most effective approach for improving the accuracy of our model because one of the biggest signs of drowsiness is yawning. Another addition would be incorporating a heart rate monitor such as a smart watch into the model to detect the user’s heart rate and the determine if they’re drowsy or not. The addition of a raspberry pi would improve the data collection pool and in turn improve the model on the whole because it would be taking for environmental factors into consideration. 
                    <br><br>

                    Nutrition plays a key role in your cognitive levels and concentration levels while working. Substances such as caffeine are scientifically proven to boost energy levels therefore participants who drink tea and coffee are more productive for the earliest period after the initial intake. Wholegrains improve concentration and focus; oily fish promotes brain function; blueberries boost short-term memory; eggs delay brain shrinkage; black currants are known to reduce stress and anxiety; pumpkin seeds enhance memory and act as mood boosters; sage boosts memory and concentration; nuts help prevent cognitive decline and are a good source of vitamin.
                    <br><br>

                    It is recommended that a person stretches for 5 to 10 minutes for every hour you spend working at your desk or to stretch every 30 minutes to improve blood circulation, ease muscle aches and eye strain. In addition to this, the computer user is encouraged to occasionally focus their eyes on an object far away to trigger depth perception and retina focus of the eye.

                        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                        <p>Future improvements include the DDRS Model being able to function effectively both in light and dark environmental settings.</p>
                        <p>A raspberry pi and smart watch can be used to ctest the environmental factors that contribute towards drowsiness such as room temperate, light intesity and heart rate.</p>
                        <p>Combining the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) detection with a Mouth Aspect Ratio detection system will detect whether a user is yawning which ultimately aids drowsiness detection.</p>
