        <h3><b>Explanation of Procedures</b></h3>
        <p>This study is designed to detect drowsiness within computer users along with the factors that contribute towards drowsiness. We are conducting this study to learn more about this question since the majority of the focus in the past was detecting drowsiness within drivers of vehicles. This study shifts focus to those who make use of electronic devices such as computers and laptops. Participation in the study involves completion of a questionnaire that asks you basic questions about your personal preferences with regards to your working environment and daily habits while using your computer or laptop. Thereafter the study will be conducted in a controlled environment along with an environment in which the variables are manipulated. This will take approximately one hour. The interviews will be conducted by one of the researchers, video-taped, photographed and later transcribed for the purpose of data analysis.</p>
